### Summary
After running and looking at our data on this project, I like to suggest decrease supply of Drivers on Urban area. Because, even though Urban city has highest Total Fares, but the Average Fare per Driver is very low compare with Rural, which can be mean profit on Urban can be very low. This problem can be solved as reducing Total Drivers.
The second suggession would increase drivers on Rural.
